# **App Name**: WordPlay Daily

## Core Features:

- Word Retrieval: Fetch the daily word and valid word list from external APIs.
- Guess Input: Accept user's word guess as input.
- Guess Validation: Check if the guess is a valid word using the API.
- Result Display: Display the results using the NYT Wordle color scheme (gray, yellow, green).
- Progress Tracking: Track the user's progress (guesses made) for the current game.
- Game Over Logic: Determine when the game is won or lost and display the appropriate message.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark slate gray (#3A3A3C) to emulate the somber, focused feel of the NYT Wordle interface.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#121213), providing contrast but without being distracting. The desaturated background allows the colorful guess feedback to pop.
- Accent color: A muted golden yellow (#B59F3B), to mimic the specific yellow tone used by NYT for 'present' letters. Its lower brightness and saturation avoid excessive vibrancy against the dark background.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif that is suitable for body text; the entire app will consistently use this font
- Simple, minimalist icons for game actions (e.g., play again).
- Grid-based layout for letter inputs, mimicking the NYT Wordle style.
- Subtle animations for letter reveal and game over messages.
